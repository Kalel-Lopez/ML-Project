# ML-Project
Our objective for this project was to predict Amazon's 2020 stock prices using information 
from 2016 - 2019 and using an Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to
do so. Amazonâ€™s stock price will decrease into 2019 and late into 2019 it will increase
as demand would rise when stock price lowers. That price increase leads to demand decrease in 2020.
We will check whether or not that is reflected in our model.
